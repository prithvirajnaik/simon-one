                The goal is to correctly repeat an increasingly long sequence of lights and sounds.<br>
                Simon will play a sequence starting with one tone and light.<br>
                You must press the buttons in the same order as Simon's sequence. <br>
                After each correct sequence, Simon will add one more tone and light to the sequence. <br>
                The sequence continues to grow as long as you keep repeating it correctly. <br>
                Wait for Simon to finish the sequence before pressing any buttons. <br>
                Repeat the sequence exactly as it was shown. <br>
                If you press the wrong button or the wrong order, Simon will emit a "fail" sound and the game will end.
